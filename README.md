# The Cookbook
## Obsidian Setup
Download the desktop app here: https://obsidian.md
Install the Git plugin from the Community Plugins 
  Tweak the setting to your liking. I enable auto pull on startup, auto commit every 5 minutes, and set the remote repo URL to this project. 

## Project Structure
### Top level folders
Top level folders should be plural, and encompass a genre, like Soups or Breads. 

### Tags
Within a recipe, add tags that match appropriately. Each tag should be capitalized. Example tags can include:
	#Vegan #Vegetarian #Easy #Complex #Healthy #Quick #Favorite



## Recipe Templating
Please use the recipemd format
https://recipemd.org/specification.html

For Example
# Guacamole
