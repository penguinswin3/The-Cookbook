1)  In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is glistening, add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the ginger, jalapeño, and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the pepper, cumin, and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until the tomato paste darkens, about 2 minutes more.
2) Add the crushed tomatoes, stock, sweet potatoes, chickpeas, and peanut butter and stir until combined. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.
3) Add in the kale and shredded chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, for about another 5 minutes, or until the chicken is warmed through and the kale is wilted. Adjust the salt to taste.
4) Serve topped with peanuts and cilantro, if desired.
